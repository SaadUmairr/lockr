## 1. Introduction 👋

**Lockr** is a simple but powerful **end-to-end encrypted password manager** designed for people who care deeply about privacy.

Everything you save in Lockr is encrypted right on your device — before it even touches our servers. We can’t see your data, and we don’t want to. This is what’s called **zero-knowledge encryption**: we never know your passphrase, your keys, or your passwords. Only you do.

Think of it like locking a box, keeping the key, and handing us the sealed box to hold. We’ll keep it safe, but we have no way to open it. That’s Lockr in a nutshell.

## 2. Features ✨

- 🔐 **End-to-End Encryption** – Your data is encrypted in your browser, and only you can decrypt it.
- 🔑 **Master Passphrase** – A single passphrase secures your entire vault. We never see it — and can’t recover it.
- 🗂️ **Organized "Spaces"** – Group your credentials into custom spaces like Work, Personal, or Gaming for a cleaner experience.
- ☁️ **Cross-Device Sync** – Access your encrypted vault from anywhere. Everything stays encrypted in transit and at rest.
- 🚫 **No Tracking, Ever** – We don’t collect any data, or personal info. Zero tracking.
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** – Built to be snappy and efficient, with no unnecessary overhead.

## 3. How It Works 🛠️

Here’s a quick peek under the hood:

**Frontend (The part you see):**

- **Next.js** – The framework powering a fast, smooth user experience.
- **TypeScript** – Makes our code more reliable and easier to maintain.
- **Shadcn UI** – Clean, modern components for a great interface.
- **Framer Motion** – Adds subtle animations to make everything feel more fluid.

**Backend (The part you don’t see):**

- **Neon Postgres** – Our database, storing only encrypted data.
- **Prisma** – Handles database operations in a clean and secure way.
- **Auth.js** – Handles sign-in with Google (OAuth), keeping your identity secure without touching your vault contents.
